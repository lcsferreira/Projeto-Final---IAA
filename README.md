# Data Analysis Project - IAA
During the Artificial Intelligence course, various machine learning models and data analysis techniques were studied.

## Final Project Proposal
The project involved developing an approach to make predictions using a dataset provided by the professor. Additionally, it was required to generate a .csv file with the predictions. The resulting file is named "test_LucasFerreira.csv". The goal was to achieve the highest possible accuracy.

## Dataset
The provided dataset consists of the files "teste.csv" and "treino.csv". To create them, the professor intentionally introduced various errors and complications typical of datasets to make manipulation and analysis challenging.

## Notebook
The project was developed using Google Colab, and the notebook is located in the file "LucasFerreira.ipynb". It contains explanations for each decision made during the development process.

## Conclusion
My approach may not have been ideal since I used many models and decided to use the Voting Classifier, which combines the predictions of these models. In my opinion, the ideal approach would involve performing a grid search on some model to find the best hyperparameter adjustments and focus on optimization. However, as a work and exercise, I am satisfied with my performance.
